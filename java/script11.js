Cuz the thing is I already kind of had a moment where I told somebody how I felt recently and uhm for al ong time I didn’t tell them I didn’t tell them how I felt because I thought it was a waste of time and I guess that’s still kind of heavy on my mind because now I regret dragging it on for as long as it did because I guess maybe part of me thinks that you know, you know the what-ifs, what I had said this sooner what if things were different uhm and so year I haven’t told htem that yet, that I wish I said things sooner because I felt like at this point there’s not really much I can do and at this point there’s not much that can chane and it’s just kind of happened and it’s something we’re both gonna have to deal with now. I guess I haven’t told him yet beacuse I don’t think that situation has changed </p>";
